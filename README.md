Project Scope
We are looking to a create an interactive visualization that gives users an overview of freight movement patterns throughout the US. We have not decided on the type of freight or the overall goal of this visualization. 

Here are two ideas we are considering:

This visualization could be used to map the movement of goods compared to the overall GDP of each state. Which states rely heavily on imports and which states can be considered more “locally sourced”? When a good does cross state lines, is it going one state over or across the nation? This can be used to track the overall carbon footprint of goods. 

Another idea to consider is the volume and weight of goods crossing on highways. This visualization could help government entities identify the highways which get the most wear-and-tear.

Possible Data Sources:
1.	Freight movement within US from 2012-2015. Includes goods type (tobacco, cereal grains, fertilizers, etc.), value, weight, and miles traveled. http://faf.ornl.gov/fafweb/
2.	Border crossing goods and people between Mexico, US, and Canada. Only data for goods coming into US. https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/data
